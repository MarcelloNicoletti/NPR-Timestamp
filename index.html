        <h1>NPR Politics Timestamp Message Generator</h1>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            The
            <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510310/npr-politics-podcast">
                NPR Politics Podcast
            </a>
            starts every episode with a fan submitted timestamp message.
            Normally, a host from the show inturupts the message for a second to
            read the time the episode was recorded. I wanted to make a way to
            generate a timestamp message that didn't need to be inturrupted. At
            the same time I wanted to learn some JavaScript programming. So I
            decided I should make a website that generates timestamp messages.
            Now about 300 lines of my own JavaScript and 127 sound clips later I
            have made this site that does just that. Enter a time and date and
            this site will generate a timestamp message including that time and
            date read by Me!

        </div>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
            Select a time and date in the fields above. Clicking Play will play
            a preview of the timestamp message without downloading it. Clicking
            Download will download the timestamp message without playing it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any blank input fields will automatically be filled with values from
            the current time and date when either the Play or Download button is
            pressed. You can click a button with nothing entered to
            automatically fill in all fields at once.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you try to generate a timestamp using a number that doesn't make
            sense (ex. 13 o'clock on the 37th of the month) you will cause
            an error (for now). A message should appear if an error happens
            (likely "404 resources/X.mp3 not found") Until (or unless) I fix it,
            you will need to refresh the site to be able to use it again.
