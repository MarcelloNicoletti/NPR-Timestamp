# NPR Timestamp Project

A github page that generates a timestamp for the NPR Politics podcast.

------

Currently all of the timestamps have been interrupted by a podcast host to
read the recording time.
My goal with this page is to make a basic time to speech system based on
recordings of my voice.
A user should be able to configure the time and download a sound file that
contains that time read out by me.
